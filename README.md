This repository mainly functions for me as a backup of smaller projects, i had to do in university as a master student. It may generally be useful for others who are interested in computational biology/biophysics as a showcase of topics, one may encounter in its studies. Most of the projects presented are edited by me and may contain additional information, as well as links to papers regarding the topic. General mathematical topics covered in these projects are:
<ul>
 <li>nonlinear equation</li>
 <li>stability theory of complex systems, such as lyapunov coefficients, strange attractors, limit cycles, bifurcation etc. </li>
 <li>network science/graph theory especially for modeling populations,see sociograms</li>
 </ul>
Which are applied to the following biological topics:
<ul>
<li>Epidemiological models and vaccination strategy in populations</li>
<li>genetic circuits in bacteria, see "genetic toggle switch" and "repressilator"</li>
<li>general description of populations</li>
</ul>
